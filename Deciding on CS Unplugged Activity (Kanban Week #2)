This was the week when we had to finalize the CS Unplugged activity that we would choose ater listening to everyone's thoughts.

After discussing for couple of hours and analysing all the ideas thoroughly, we landed up on the decision to go with Text Compression activity.

This activity was decided over the others because of the following crucial reasons - 

1. Text and other types of compressions are ubiquitous.
2. Will be interesting for non computer science as well.
3. Easy for everyone to understand.
4. Will teach our team a lot about different compression techniques.
5. Various game ideas to choose from

So with all the reasons mentioned above our team decided to go with text compression.

Now, the next task in the list is to select a game that would be most suitable for people to understand text compression.
Every team member had their own idea, hence, some time has been given to us for analysing the feasibility of various game ideas discussed.
By next week we will have a clear idea of what we are going to build.
